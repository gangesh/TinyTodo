How to install myTinyTodo

   Then click "Install" to create tables in database. It's recommended to delete this file after installation.
3. To protect your tasks from modification by the others you may specify password in settings.<br>
   By default session files are stored in 'tmp/sessions' directory. Make sure it's writable for webserver/php.
